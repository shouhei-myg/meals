Your project requires compiled gems that are not currently available.  Unavailable pre-compiled gems:
<% missing_gems.each do |missing_gem|
   available = missing_gem['available'].reject { |v| missing_gem['gem_name'].include?(v) }
%>
* Unavailable: <%= missing_gem['gem_name'] -%> Available versions: <%= available.join(' ') %>
<% end %>
Your current serverlessgems source: #{gems_source}

Jets is unable to build a deployment package that will work on AWS Lambda without the required pre-compiled gems. To remedy this, you can:

* Use another gem that does not require compilation.
* Create your own custom layer with the gem: http://rubyonjets.com/docs/extras/custom-lambda-layers/
<% if agree.yes? -%>
* No need to report this to us, as we've already been notified.
<% elsif agree.no? -%>
* You have choosen not to report data to serverlessgems so we will not be notified about these missing gems.
* You can edit ~/.jets/agree to change this.
* Reporting gems generally allows Serverless Gems to build the missing gems within a few minutes.
* You can try redeploying again after a few minutes.
* Non-reported gems may take days or even longer to be built.
<% end -%>

Compiled gems usually take some time to figure out how to build as they each depend on different libraries and packages.

    # Context, observations, and history:
    #
    # Two ways to check if gem is compiled.
    #
    #     1. compiled_gem_paths - look for .so and .bundle extension files in the folder itself.
    #     2. gemspec - uses the gemspec metadata.
    #
    # Observations:
    #
    #     * The gemspec approach generally finds more compiled gems than the compiled_gem_paths approach.
    #     * So when using the compiled_gem_paths some compiled are missed and not properly detected like http-parser.
    #     * However, some gemspec found compiled gems like json are weird and they don't work when they get replaced.
    #
    # History:
    #
    #     * Started with compiled_gem_paths approach
    #     * Tried to gemspec approach, but ran into json-2.1.0 gem issues. bundler removes? http://bit.ly/39T8uln
    #     * Went to selective checking approach with `cli: true` option. This helped gather more data.
    #       * jets deploy - compiled_gem_paths
    #       * jets gems:check - gemspec_compiled_gems
    #     * Going back to compiled_gem_paths with:
    #       * Using the `weird_gem?` check to filter out gems removed by bundler. Note: Only happens with specific versions of json.
    #     * Keeping compiled_gem_paths for Jets Afterburner mode. Default to gemspec_compiled_gems otherwise
    #
    #
    def compiled_gems
      # @use_gemspec option  finds compile gems with Gem::Specification
      # The normal build process does not use this and checks the file system.
      # So @use_gemspec is only used for this command:
      #
      #   jets gems:check
      #
      # This is because it seems like some gems like json are remove and screws things up.
      # We'll filter out for the json gem as a hacky workaround, unsure if there are more
      # gems though that exhibit this behavior.
      if @options[:use_gemspec] == false

        # This handles the possiblity of stale gems leftover from previous builds
        # in the cache.
